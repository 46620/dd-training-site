# Misc Fixes

!!! info
    This list is very unprofessional, I do not care. This will be a lot of fixes to things, most of which will seem like common sense.

## The scanner isn't working
Unscrew the screw on the bottom of the register, if it's even screwed in, and plug the unplugged cable there into one of the open "SER" ports.

## Sticker machine is printing weird
Change the stickers.

## Receipts are printing weird
Change the paper.

## POS is frozen
Wait for it to unfreeze, if you keep tapping the screen it's not gonna unfreeze it faster.

## XYZ is not working
Restart it or plug it back in.
