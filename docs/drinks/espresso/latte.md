# Latte

A latte is the most generic espresso drink, it's also one of the easiest to make.

To start, brew a shot of espresso into a small metal pitcher. This is to help temper it and give the latte a better flavor.

Next, pour the milk into another pitcher. Smalls can also go into a small pitcher, medium and large have to go into the bigger pitcher. There are lines on the inside that show you where to stop pouring. If the latte is hot, steam the milk. **MAKE SURE TO WIPE THE STEAMING WAND AFTER EVERY USE WITH A BLUE RAG FROM THE SANITIZER BUCKET**

Then, add the flavors that the customer wants into the cup. Afterwards, pour the espresso into the milk pitcher and mix it all together.

Lastly, pour the latte into the cup and serve. Don't forget to add ice if it's iced.
