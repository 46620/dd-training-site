Taking temps is easy, just kinda annoying.

>Due to stores having multiple different setups, I will not be specific with what to temp, as your store may not have a "Walk-in Freezer" 
or will have an extra thing for making bagels

=== "Paperback"
    1. Get the thermometer
    2. Take the temperature of the item you are at
    3. Write it down
    4. Repeat until everything is done
=== "Tablet"
    1. Get the thermometer
    2. Get the tablet and login using your password (ask your manager, not me for it)
    3. Select what you want to temp and temp that item
    4. If it's out of range, don't just lie. Put in the temperature shown on the thermometer so it alerts people there is an issue
    5. Repeat until everything is done
