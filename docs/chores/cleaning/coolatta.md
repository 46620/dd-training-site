# Coolatta machines

Coolattas are a drink that people order a lot of. We gotta keep the machine(s) that make them clean, as with everything else in the store.

    !!! notes "Possibly not finished"
        This section is possibly unfinished and missing information. The bulk of the information is correct.
    1. Lift the base off. The base is the giant piece of plastic that goes over the spray head, as well as the spot right in front of where you put the pitcher.
    2. Take off the bezel. The plastic clip to do so was behind the base. Push the clip in, then pull the bezel outwards.
    3. Take out the splash guard. There's 2 plastic tabs you need you push to take them out.
    4. Clean everything, make sure to not lose the metal bar or the plastic triggers for the cleaning spout.
    5. Once everything is cleaned, sanitized, and dried, put everything back in. Make sure to but the bezel back on before you put the base on, it's easier that way.

    >I literally don't know the name of this machine. My store hasn't had one of these in around 4-5 years so this WILL be off of memory. If any part is wrong please tell me.

    2. Remove the rotation metal piece and the O-ring.
    3. Clean each piece.
    4. Relube the O-ring before putting it back in the machine.
