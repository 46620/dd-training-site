    This guide will be for Turbo Chef Ovens and Hatco toasters.

Firstly, empty out all the warmers and turn them off if not done already. Wipe out the inside if there are crumbs in it. If somehow cheese gets on the inside and burns on, you need to ask God to help with that.

Next turn the toaster off, hold the power button until it says the cooling fans are on, pressing it does nothing. After it cools down, take the rack off the ramp. Then wipe the ramp down and put it in the sink.

Then remove the filter on the toaster and clean that out, it's under the ramp is and just slides out. Gently smack it against the counter or wash it to clear it.

Next brush off and clear crumbs from the white board and slicer. Throw them at the sink.

Cleaning the oven will be added in the future, since we no longer have the normal cleaner, we got new stuff.
