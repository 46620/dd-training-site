# Espresso Machine

!!! info
    This guide is specifically for the "Schaerer Coffee Art Plus".

On the main brewing screen, click the icon in the bottom left and then press "Cleaning", it will then ask you to empty the ground container. If you just emptied it, pull it out, wait a few seconds, and then put it back in. Next grab one of the cleaning tablets for the machine, they will be in a small bottle underneath one of the machines. Open the slot on the top of the machine and throw that sucker in. Press continue and wait for it to finish.

Once it's finished, pull the grounds container out, and using a brush, just sweep the back of the hole fowards, sometimes grounds get stuck back there and will cause the machine to think it needs to be emptied when it's empty already.

After that you can wipe down the body and pour water into the bowl area to clear out any grounds that are visible.
